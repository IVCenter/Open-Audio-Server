==Project Overview==

Rich, 3D environments need sound to provide the user a feeling of complete immersion. When visualization is provided by a cluster of computers, the sound processing can be handled by a dedicated machine that is in turn connected to the speakers and other audio equipment. The OpenAL Audio Server (OAS) provides this functionality via a network interface on a Linux machine. OAS is based loosely on the aging Windows DirectSound [http://www.calit2.net/~jschulze/projects/audioserver/ AudioServer] project by Marc Schreier, and is backwards compatible.

==Status==
* '''Server Backend'''
-- The backend of the server is functional. Connections can be made, instructions and audio files can be sent, and audio can be played, stopped, moved, etc.<br>
-- All network input and output is handled by a dedicated thread that parses the input into discrete audio instructions and queues it up. <br>
-- A separate thread retrieves these instructions from the queue and performs the desired action (i.e. play sound, move sound position, etc.) <br>
-- File format support is limited only by the OpenAL extensions that are installed on the audio server.<br>
-- Server is persistent and stable between different connections. <br>
-- Server settings (port, cache directory, etc.) are read from an XML configuration file.

* '''Server Frontend'''
-- The frontend of the server uses FLTK and currently consists of a tabbed interface. <br>
-- The frontend also resides in its own thread, allowing the user interface to operate independently from the backend of the server. <br>
-- Errors are displayed in bold, warnings are displayed in italics, and informative messages contain no special formatting. <br>

* '''Client API'''
-- Undergoing testing. <br>

==Client-Server Communication Protocol==

===Notes on Message Format===
The general format for each message passed from client to the server is a four letter, uppercase
message identifier, followed by any relevant parameters. Since the protocol is in ASCII plain-text,
even integer and floating point numbers are passed as plaintext. Two different messages can be
separated by a newline character.

Parameters to messages can be separated by commas, semicolons, or extra spaces. The server's parser 
is lenient with how parameters are separated. So,
<pre>SSPO 4, 3.5, 6, 2.5</pre>
is the same as
<pre>SSPO 4 3.5 6 2.5</pre>
is the same as
<pre>SSPO 4; 3.5, 6, 2.5</pre>
is the same as
<pre>SSPO 4;;;;;  3.5,, ;6; 2.5</pre>
However, it is recommended that you stay true to a convention. The provided client API uses the
following convention, to minimize the number of bytes sent over the network:
<pre>SSPO 4 3.5 6 2.5</pre>

===The Protocol===

{| border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
|- align="center"
! scope="col" width="35%" | Message and Example(s)
! scope="col" width="65%" | Description
|-
| 
GHDL filename
<pre>GHDL beachsound.wav</pre>
|
Load '''filename''' into a sound source, and return a handle for accessing the source. If 
'''filename''' cannot be found in the server's cache directory, or a sound source cannot be
created for '''filename''', the server will respond with "-1". Otherwise, the response will be a
handle number, with values "0", "1", "2", "3", etc.
|-
|
WAVE type frequency phase duration
<pre>WAVE 1 261.3 0.0 3.5</pre>
|
Generate a new sound source based on the specified simple waveform. Similar to GHDL, the server 
will respond with a non-negative integer value in ASCII form on success, which will be the handle
for the generated source. On failure, the server will respond with "-1".
<br> <br>
The first parameter, '''type''', describes the shape of the wave that should be generated, and takes
the following values:

{| border="1"
|- 
! ''Type''
! Wave Type
|-
! scope="row" | 1 
| Sinusoidal
|-
! scope="row" | 2 
| Square
|-
! scope="row" | 3 
| Sawtooth
|-
! scope="row" | 4 
| Whitenoise
|-
! scope="row" | 5 
| Impulse
|}

'''Frequency''' specifies the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency frequency] of the waveform, and can be
a floating point number.<br>
'''Phase''' specifies the phase shift of the waveform, in degrees from -180 to +180, and can be a floating point.<br>
'''Duration''' specifies how long the sound should last through one playback, in seconds, and can be a floating point.
<br> <br>

The example creates a sinusoidal wave, with a frequency corresponding to middle-C, a phase shift of
0 degrees, and a duration of 3.5 seconds.
|-
|
RHDL handle
<pre>RHDL 1</pre>
|
Release the resources allocated for the source corresponding to '''handle'''.
|-
|
PLAY handle
<pre>PLAY 5</pre>
|
Play the source specified by '''handle'''. If the source is already playing, this will do nothing.

|-
|
STOP handle
<pre>STOP 5</pre>
|
Stop the source specified by '''handle'''. The playback position is reset to the beginning.
|-
|
SSPO handle x y z
<pre>SSPO 3 4.5 0 22.337</pre>
|
Set the position of the source specified by '''handle''' to <nowiki><</nowiki>'''x''', '''y''', '''z'''></nowiki>. 
The position values can be floating point, and have a default of <nowiki><</nowiki>0, 0, 0<nowiki>></nowiki> <br> <br>

The example sets sound 3's position to <nowiki><4.5, 0, 22.337></nowiki>.
|-
|
SSVE handle x y z
<pre>SSVE 2 5.0 0 0</pre>
|
Set the velocity of the sound specified by '''handle''' to <nowiki><x, y, z></nowiki>. These values are only used for
doppler effect calculations. OpenAL does not use the velocity for updating the sound's position, and OAS conforms to 
this specification. See the doppler effect for more information on how it works in OAS and OpenAL.
<br> <br>
The example sets sound 2's velocity to 5.0 in the X direction.
|-
|
SSVO handle gain
<pre>SSVO 17 0.85</pre>
|
Set the gain (volume) of the sound specified by '''handle''' to '''gain'''. A gain of 0 will mute the sound
completely, and the default gain for all sounds is 1. A gain of 0.5 corresponds to an attenuation of 6 dB. A gain
value greater than 1.0 (to amplify the sound) is possible. However, the final gain value (after source-to-listener 
distance and orientation attentuation calculations) may be clamped by the sound card and drivers. If portability
between systems is a key issue, it is not recommended to have widespread use of gain values greater than 1. 
<br> <br>
The example sets sound 17's gain to 0.85, which will be quieter than the default.
|-
|
SSLP handle doLoop
<pre>SSLP 3 1</pre>
|
Set the sound specified by '''handle''' to loop continuously, or to disable looping. The parameter '''doLoop''' takes
boolean values of 0 or 1, with '''0''' disabling looping, and '''1''' enabling looping. A sound with looping enabled
will resume playback from the beginning immediately after it is finished playing all the way through. Sounds have
looping disabled by default. 
<br> <br>
The example turns looping on in sound 3.
|-
|
SSDI handle x y z
<pre>SSDI 3 0.5 0.0 -2.5</pre>
|
Set the direction of the sound specified by '''handle'''. The sound's direction is the vector specified by 
<nowiki><</nowiki>'''x''', '''y''', '''z'''<nowiki>></nowiki>. If the sound does not point towards the listener,
the listener will not hear the sound at full volume. If the sound is pointing completely away from the listener, then
it will not be audible at all. When the direction vector is the default of <nowiki><</nowiki>0,0,0<nowiki>></nowiki>,
the sound source has no direction associated with it. Sound is then emitted equally in all directions, similarly to
a point light source. 
<br> <br>
The example sets the direction of sound 3 to <nowiki><</nowiki>0.5, 0.0, -2.5<nowiki>></nowiki>.
|-
|
SSDI handle angle
<pre>SSDI 3 2.944</pre>
|
Set the direction of the sound specified by '''handle''' using '''angle''', in radians. The angle is converted to a unit
vector in the X-Z plane using sine and cosine. There is no default angle value, because sound sources are not
directional by default.. Once you use this version of SSDI on a sound source, the sound source will remain directional 
until you use "SSDI handle 0 0 0", to fully disable the directionality.
<br> <br>
The example has the same result as the example for SSDI with a vector parameter. The direction of sound 3 is set to 
2.944 radians.
|-
|
SSDV handle angle gain
<pre>SSDV 3 2.944 0.869</pre>
|
Set both the direction and gain of the sound given by '''handle'''. The direction is specified by '''angle''', in radians,
and the volume is set by '''gain'''. This effectively combines two messages: SSDI with the angle parameter and SSVO.
<br> <br>
The example sets the direction and gain of sound 3 to 2.944 and 0.869, respectively.
|-
|
SPIT handle pitch
<pre>SPIT 3 1.25</pre>
|
Set the pitch of sound specified by '''handle'''. '''Pitch''' can be any floating point greater than 0. A value of 1 is
the default. Doubling the pitch will increase the pitch of the sound by one octave, and halving the pitch will drop the
sound by one octave. Modifying the pitch also changes the playback speed, so a sound with pitch greater than 1 will play
at a faster speed, and a sound with a pitch less than 1 will play at a slower speed.
<br> <br>
The example sets the pitch of sound 3 to 1.25.
|-
|
FADE handle gain time
<pre>FADE 12 0.7 4</pre>
|
Gradually and linearly change the sound's current gain value to the specified '''gain''' value, over the duration
'''time''', in seconds. This can be used to slowly fade a sound's volume in or out, such as, but not limited to, when
introducing objects/scenes or transitioning between different objects/scenes. Both '''gain''' and '''time''' can be
floating point.
<br> <br>
The example fades sound twelve's current gain value (whatever it may be) to 0.7, over the course of 4 seconds.
|-
|
GAIN value
<pre>GAIN 0.0</pre>
|
Change the gain (volume) for the listener to '''value'''. The default gain for the listener is 1.0. This can be useful
especially to mute all sounds for the listener, as the example demonstrates.
|-
|
SLPO x y z
<pre>SLPO 20.12 0.008 -9.23</pre>
|
Set the listener's position to <nowiki><</nowiki>'''x''', '''y''', '''z'''<nowiki>></nowiki>, in the same coordinate 
system as the sound sources. The default position is <nowiki><</nowiki>0, 0, 0<nowiki>></nowiki>
<br> <br>
The example sets the position to <nowiki><</nowiki>20.12, 0.008, -9.23<nowiki>></nowiki>.
|-
|
SLOR aX aY aZ uX uY uZ
<pre>SLOR 1 0 0 0 1 0</pre>
|
Set the listener's orientation using two vectors. The first, 
<nowiki><</nowiki>'''aX''', '''aY''', '''aZ'''<nowiki>></nowiki>, specifies the "look-at" direction. The second,
<nowiki><</nowiki>'''uX''', '''uY''', '''uZ'''<nowiki>></nowiki>, specifies the "up" direction. If two vectors are linearly 
dependent, the behavior is undefined. They do not need to be normalized. The defaults are 
<nowiki><</nowiki>0, 0, -1<nowiki>></nowiki> for the look-at vector and <nowiki><</nowiki>0, -1, 0<nowiki>></nowiki> for the 
up vector.
<br> <br>
The example sets the listener's orientation to <nowiki><</nowiki>1, 0, 0<nowiki>></nowiki> for the look-at vector and
<nowiki><</nowiki>0, 1, 0<nowiki>></nowiki> for the up vector.
|-
|
SLVE x y z
<pre>SLVE -2.0 0 0</pre>
|
Set the listener's velocity to <nowiki><</nowiki>'''x''', '''y''', '''z'''<nowiki>></nowiki>. Similar to setting a sound source's
velocity, the server does not update the position of the listener based on this specified velocity. It is only used as a 
parameter for doppler effect calculations. See the doppler effect calculations section for more information.
<br> <br>
The example sets the velocity of the listener to -2.0 in the X direction.
|
|-
|
SSVE handle speed
<pre>SSVE 6 3.5</pre>
|
('''''deprecated''''') <br>
Set the sound's speed. The sound's current direction is used to compute the effective velocity. This assumes
that the sound is moving in the same direction it is facing. Note that if the sound has no direction associated with it, the
behavior is undefined. This message is leftover to support old applications that were tailored to the old Windows AudioServer
project. New applications should avoid using this functionality, or use at their own risk.
<br> <br>
The example sets sound 6's speed to 3.5.

There were some messages that had inconsistent, incomplete, or altogether broken support in the old Windows AudioServer.
This meant that in order to maintain full backwards compatibility, OAS would have had to implement these deprecated 
messages in a similar, broken manner. Instead, support for these messages has been dropped completely, under the
assumption that old client applications would not be dependent on something that was broken. Support may be added in
the future as needed.
